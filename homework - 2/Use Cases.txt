The system is accessed through the internet from its initial URL. It
loads header, navigation bar and a home page.


Use Case 2 (Navigation bar)
The navigation bar has navigational hyperlinks to the Home, Product
category, Store finder, Login and Registration option, All Products. As well as it should have navigation to
the Checkout and Search.


Use Case 3 (Home page)
The home page shows the Product blocks in random order in a slider section. 
Clicking on the banners leads to the relevant category with products.
Latest products section should be available at the bottom.



Use Case 4 (Search)
Clicking on Search from in the header allows for product finds by given keywords. 
If we have such products, we should show a list with the results. 
If no product is found, we should display error message stating that 
“Sorry, but nothing matched your search criteria. Please try again with some different keywords.”
