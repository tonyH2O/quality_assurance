---------- Sunglasses made by recycled skate desks:

2 - Are they really protecting the user from the Sun, check what the glass itself is made of


3 - Check if the glasses will cause trouble with limited vision if the glass itself is darker or it will be clear and easy to see


4 - Check if the glasses will be heavy or light and easy to wear and use daily
