---------- Waterproof playing cards with 3 jokers in the deck:



1 - Check if the material the cards are made of will cause an Allergic Reactions to the users


2 - Check if the Cards are actually waterproof by putting them under water or playing in the rain


3 - Check the duration of how long will the Deck last under bad conditions - left couple of days in the rain outside


4 - Make sure there are no duplicate cards other than the 4 Jokers in the Deck and the Artwork is on point as intended


5 - The Cards are waterproof but is this going to make them break easily? Check the edges of the cards for damage after playing as well!
