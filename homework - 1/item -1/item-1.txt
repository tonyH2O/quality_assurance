------- EKO Pen made with recycled paper and with blue ink :



1 - We would need to check if the Blue Ink will actually spill on a paper or other surface areas
	( there are many pens that are spilling their ink if pressed harder against a paper ) 


2 - In the case of Black Box Testing, we need to make sure it is really made of EKO Recycled Paper
	( people who are using it may not want to be scammed by an EKO company )


3 - Test if the material that is made of can cause an allergic reaction to the user


4 - Test if the Pen is doing what it is suppose to do - writting and if it has a strong grip for comfort


5 - How long will it last before breaking in half or the Ink will run empty
